# asteroid-generator

Randomly creates procedural 3D "asteroids" by distorting the points of the platonic solids along the surface of their bounding sphere.

## Usage

(TBD)

## TODO

- Implement the other solids (octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron)
- Fine tune the output
- Fine tune performance
- Turn it into some sort of module so I can...
- build something to consume this! :D
